                <h1>Template Injection Learning Platform</h1>
                <h2>Welcome to Template Injection vulnerabilities</h2>
                <p><strong>Unlock the Secrets of Web Security</strong></p>
                <p>In the ever-evolving world of web development, security stands as a cornerstone of trust and reliability. Here, you can delve deep into the intricate realm of Template Injection (TI) vulnerabilities, unlocking mysteries that both challenge and define modern web security.</p>
                <h3>Why Focus on TI or more specifically SSTI?</h3>
                <p>Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) is a critical security vulnerability that occurs in web applications that, in the worst-case, can lead to remote code execution (RCE). It arises when user input is inadequately sanitized and templates are improperly handled by web servers. Understanding SSTI is crucial as it highlights the vulnerabilities in server-side templating systems, which are a fundamental component in modern web application development. By learning about SSTI, developers and security professionals can better identify, prevent, and mitigate these types of vulnerabilities, leading to more secure web applications.</p>
